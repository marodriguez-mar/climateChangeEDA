# Climate Change: Past, Present, Future

This Python program was the final project for my Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization with Python course. I worked with a team of my peers to extract climate change datasets and create a cohesive narrative using the visualization skills we learned in the course. We used data on histrorical climate related trends, country GHG emissions, natural disasters, GDP, and renewable enegy production. We focsued on identifying countries who have made significant contributions to the climate crisis, countries that are facing the ramifications of a warming climate, and countries that are attempting to make efforts at alleivating the harm through energy investments.
